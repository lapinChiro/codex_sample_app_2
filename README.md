# Online Memo App

This is a simple Streamlit-based memo application with user login.
It includes memo editing, search, an offline indicator, and a settings screen.

## Setup

Install dependencies and run the app:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app uses a local SQLite database `memo.db`.
